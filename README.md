# AI Weather Reporter Automation System

## Problem Solved
I developed this n8n automation to enable users to effortlessly receive real-time, customized weather data without manually checking weather sources. It streamlines the process of accessing specific weather information for a requested location.

## Solution Overview
This system utilizes n8n as its core automation engine. Users fill out a Lovable form specifying the location for weather updates. The n8n workflow then takes this input, integrates with a weather API (WeatherAPI.com) to fetch the data, processes it (including JavaScript-based validation), stores relevant information in a Supabase database, and finally delivers a comprehensive weather report directly to the user's email inbox via Gmail SMTP.

## Key Tools & Integrations Used
* **n8n:** The primary workflow automation platform.
* **Lovable forms:** Used for user input.
* **WeatherAPI.com:** Provides real-time weather data via its API.
* **Supabase:** Utilized for efficient database management.
* **Gmail SMTP:** For reliable email delivery.
* **Custom JavaScript:** Implemented within n8n nodes for data validation and custom logic.
* **API Integrations:** For seamless connection with external services.

## Visuals & Demo
### N8n Workflow Screenshot
(Optional: Take a clear screenshot of your n8n workflow for this "AI Weather Reporter" project. Save the image as a `.png` file. **To add images when editing directly on GitHub, you will need to upload them separately after this step.** For now, you can leave this placeholder or remove it if you don't have images yet. If you want to add images later, you'd navigate to the `ai-weather-reporter` folder on GitHub, click "Add file" -> "Upload files", then create an `images` folder and upload your screenshots there. Then, you'd come back and edit this `README.md` to add the link like: `![N8n Workflow](ai-weather-reporter/images/ai-weather-reporter-workflow.png)`)

### Live Demo
(Highly Recommended: Record a short video (e.g., using Loom or YouTube) showing the automation in action â€“ from filling the Lovable form to receiving the email. Upload it to YouTube or Loom and paste the public link here.)

## Impact & Results
This automation significantly improved user convenience by providing effortless access to real-time weather data. It eliminated the need for manual checks, ensuring users receive accurate and timely information directly to their inbox, enhancing overall efficiency and user satisfaction.

## My Role
I designed, developed, and deployed the entire end-to-end automation system, including form integration, API calls, data handling, and email delivery using n8n and associated services.
